## Filing Issues

If you are filing an issue for a bug or other misbehavior, please provide:

- **A test case.** The more minimal the better, but sometimes a larger test case
  cannot be helped. This should be in the form of a gist, node script,
  repository, etc.

- **Steps to reproduce the bug.** The more exact and specific the better.

- **The result you expected.**

- **The actual result.**

## Building From Source

Install Node.js `12` or greater and then run

    $ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/source-map.git
    $ cd source-map/
    $ npm install

Next, run

    $ npm run build

This will create the following files:

- `dist/source-map.js` - The plain browser build.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Make sure that tests pass locally before creating a pull request.

Use a feature branch and pull request for each change, with logical commits. If
your reviewer asks you to make changes before the pull request is accepted,
fixup your existing commit(s) rather than adding follow up commits, and then
force push to the remote branch to update the pull request.

## Running Tests

The test suite is written for node.js. Install node.js `12` or greater and
then run the tests with `npm test`:

```shell
$ npm test
> source-map@0.7.3 test /Users/fitzgen/src/source-map
> node test/run-tests.js


137 / 137 tests passed.
```

## Writing New Tests

To add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-your-new-test-name.js` and
export your test functions with names that start with "test", for example:

```js
exports["test issue #123: doing the foo bar"] = function (assert) {
  ...
};
```

The new tests will be located and run automatically when you run the full test
suite.

The `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have
access to the following assertion functions:

- `doesNotThrow`

- `equal`

- `ok`

- `strictEqual`

- `throws`

(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the
tests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and Firefox has a shimmed
version of the assert module.)

There are additional test utilities and helpers in `./test/util.js` which you
can use as well:

```js
var util = require("./util");
```

## Checking code coverage

It's fun to find ways to test lines of code that aren't visited by the tests yet.

```shell
$ npm run coverage
$ open coverage/index.html
```

This will allow you to browse to red sections of the code that need more attention.

## Updating the `lib/mappings.wasm` WebAssembly Module

Ensure that you have the Rust toolchain installed:

```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

The exact toolchain version is pinned in `wasm-mappings/rust-toolchain.toml`
and `rustup` will install it on demand, including the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.
Note: The pin exists because CI rebuilds the
committed artifacts and fails if they differ byte-for-byte, which only works
if everyone builds with the same compiler.

Install [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/), which is the
only other tool required -- it vendors its own `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-opt`:

```
$ cargo install wasm-pack
```

Make sure the crate's tests pass:

```
$ cd wasm-mappings/
$ cargo test
```

Then rebuild the shipped artifacts:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

This writes five files into `lib/`:

| File                          | Purpose                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `mappings.wasm`               | the WebAssembly module itself                |
| `mappings-glue.js`            | `wasm-bindgen` glue for Node (CommonJS)      |
| `mappings-glue.d.ts`          | types for the above node glue file           |
| `mappings-glue-browser.mjs`   | `wasm-bindgen` glue for browsers (ES module) |
| `mappings-glue-browser.d.mts` | types for the above browser glue file        |

All five are generated and committed; do not edit them by hand. `package.json`'s
`browser` field swaps `lib/read-wasm.js` for `lib/read-wasm-browser.js`, which
is what selects between the Node and browser glue.

Set `PROFILING=1` to enable the crate's `profiling` feature, which wraps each
query in a `console.time` / `console.timeEnd` pair:

```
$ PROFILING=1 ./build.sh
```
